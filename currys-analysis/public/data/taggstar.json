The term itself isn't a rigidly defined industry category.  However, I can suggest 5 types of companies, and give examples (where possible UK-based) that offer services relevant to building social proof messaging:\n\n1. **Customer Review Platforms/Widgets:** These platforms collect and display customer reviews, testimonials, and ratings, which are a core element of social proof.  They often offer widgets for embedding this content on websites.\n\n   * **Example:** Trustpilot (While headquartered in Denmark, they are widely used in the UK).  Trustpilot offers businesses tools to collect reviews, manage their online reputation, and showcase positive feedback through website widgets and other integrations.\n\n2. **Social Media Management Tools:** These tools help businesses manage their social media presence and can be used to highlight user-generated content (UGC), another form of social proof.  They can also facilitate social listening to understand customer sentiment and identify opportunities for social proof.\n\n   * **Example:** Buffer (While not exclusively UK-based, they serve a global market including the UK). Buffer allows scheduling and analysis of social media posts, enabling businesses to amplify positive customer mentions and engage with their audience.\n\n3. **Marketing Automation Platforms:** These platforms often include features for incorporating social proof into marketing campaigns, such as displaying customer testimonials in email marketing or on landing pages.\n\n   * **Example:** HubSpot (US-based but with a strong UK presence). HubSpot offers a suite of marketing tools, including features for managing customer reviews and incorporating social proof into various marketing channels.\n\n4. **Website Personalization Platforms:** These platforms can dynamically display social proof messaging based on user behavior or demographics.  For example, they might show testimonials from customers in the same location or with similar purchase history.\n\n   * **Example:**  While finding a UK-specific company solely focused on this is difficult, many larger personalization platforms like Optimizely (US-based) offer these capabilities.\n\n5. **User-Generated Content (UGC) Platforms/Agencies:** These platforms or agencies specialize in collecting and curating UGC, which can then be used as social proof in marketing materials.  They might help businesses run campaigns to encourage customers to create and share content.\n\n   * **Example:**  Finding a purely UK-focused UGC platform is challenging.  Many marketing and creative agencies in the UK offer UGC services as part of their broader offering.  You'd likely need to research agencies specializing in social media marketing or influencer marketing.\n\n\nIt's important to note that the best solution for a business will depend on its specific needs and goals.
